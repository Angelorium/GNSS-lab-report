## Abstract 
This report aims to explore the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS),  potential attacks (spoofing) and weaknesses (interferences). We performed our measurement in different conditions and then we analysed those data collections and discussed about the output plots highlighting the significant results and differences.
